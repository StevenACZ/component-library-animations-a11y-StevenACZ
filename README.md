# Animations

Modify your component library adding animations for the buttons, list items, checkboxes, radio buttons and image gallery items. Finally, add to your component library some animated icons as well.

Find the design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/B9OvjJrMOqD0Wy38zHE2VS/Component-Library-Animations?node-id=696%3A16).

## Take into consideration:

- Use [animista](https://animista.net/play/basic) to have some idea on how to make your own animations
- Use this tutorial to know [how to animate a checkbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojWA8pdT-zY)

Have fun and don't forget to ask for help when you get stuck.
